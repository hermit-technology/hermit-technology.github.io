# Guidelines For Editing

Given that this website currently has no readers and serves as our knowledge base, we want contribution to be as painless as possible. Write frequently, preferably every time a decision is made that unearths some new value or principle, or you come across one in reading material. Err way on the side of too much, and aim to produce a resource which we genuinely refer to as a source of inspiration, meaning, and wisdom.

Don't hesitate to delete things if they don't seem applicable in light of new experience. We can always roll changes back if there's a disagreement. Exercise some director energy.

Feel free to merge straight to main until we have frequent readers. There are no consequences to errors right now.
