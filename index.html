    <section>
        <p>This page contains Hermit Technology's values, principles, and practices. We use strict definitions of these
            terms, derived from Kent Beck's book "Extreme Programming Explained". This document should be updated
            frequently,
            be as large as it needs to be, and otherwise serve as the source of how we operate. In the spirit of
            Extreme,
            the hope is that everything we do either embodies a value or applies a principle.
        </p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <p>Values are the things that we hold as useful at their core, and are the axes along which we apply judgement.
            We might value communication, which means that we might judge outputs that excel along some
            lines but embody poor communication to be lacking.
        </p>
        <h3>Practices</h3>
        <p>Practices are specific things that we do in order to manifest our values. If we value
            communication but find that we're losing track of the direction of the company due to everyone working
            remotely,
            we might have a weekly call to discuss issues we're facing, or a chat channel where work is posted every
            day. A
            practice that isn't rooted in a value, or that doesn't feel like it relates to a value clearly, is dead to
            us. They should be terminated with extreme prejudice.

        </p>
        <h3>Principles</h3>
        <p>Principles bridge the gap between values and practices, ensuring that we have broad guidelines to refer to
            when
            assessing our practices, and that more-or-less embody wisdom that we've acquired the hard way. For example,
            we
            might have a principle that says the team is more effective when we receive daily updates from everyone on
            core
            work. We might have another principle that says disagreement is easier over high-bandwidth channels such as
            voice or video calls. Applying these principles leads to two practices. One is an end-of-day update on how
            the day went, and the other is that anyone is free to fall back to a call whenever they're feeling like a
            conversation is trending towards confrontation.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#E09133;">All of our ability with all of our capacity</h2>

        <h4>Our self-respect hinges on doing work we are proud of. Our wellbeing hinges on our work life balance. </h4>

        <p>In order to protect the quality of our work, we give it our maximum effort every time. We check in with each
            other regularly
            to honestly assess our capacity levels, and make sure we are all supported and engaged.</p>
        <p>If we need to tag each other in, we rely on our strong mutual trust and lack of judgement.</p>
        <p>We ask for help early and offer help proactively.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2 style="color:#E09133;">Respect Production</h2>

        <h4>Executing any command against production, no matter how innocuous, can take it down. </h4>
        <p>We always pair for a second set of common sense checks before a production change.</p>

        <h4>Human error is unavoidable, no matter how simple the operation is.</h4>
        <p>In the rare instance where we must execute rote, non-automated tasks against any machine, we should be guided
            by a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6667514-the-checklist-manifesto">checklist</a>.

        <h2 style="color:#E09133;">Symbolism</h2>

        <h4>Things that are sound in isolation can become morale hazards because of prior trauma.</h4>
        <p>We don't use Jira because of prior experiences with Scrum.</p>
        <p>We use IdeaFlip over Miro because of prior experiences with digital cards.</p>

        <h4>Individual style increases emotional resonance.</h4>
        <p>When someone has worded something in a manner that they're clearly attached to aesthetically or historically,
            consult them before making edits.
        </p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2 style="color:#E09133;">Communication</h2>

        <h4>Remote, asynchronous work comes at a real social and communication cost that must be actively offset.</h4>
        <p>We have one meeting every week where we can raise issues and socialize over an actual call.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2 style="color:#E09133;">Fearlessness</h2>

        <h4>Common wisdom around programming, such as task estimation, is frequently driven by fear.</h4>
        <p>When we estimate, we try to predict how long something will actually take rather than conservative estimates.
        </p>
        <p>We work at fixed prices without hard deadlines so that clients don't pay the price for a poor estimate.</p>
