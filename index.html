    <section>
        <p>This page contains Hermit Technology's values, principles, and practices. We use strict
            definitions of these
            terms, derived from Kent Beck's book "Extreme Programming Explained".</p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <p>Values are the things that we hold as useful at their core. For example, we might value communication,
            honesty,
            and trust.</p>
        <h3>Practices</h3>
        <p>Practices are specific things that we do in order to manifest our values. For example, if we value
            communication,
            we might have a weekly call to discuss issues we're facing, or a chat channel where work is posted every
            day. A
            practice that isn't rooted in a value, or that doesn't feel like it relates to a value clearly, is dead to
            us.
            Get it out of here.</p>
        <h3>Principles</h3>
        <p>Principles bridge the gap between values and practices, ensuring that we have broad guidelines to refer to
            when
            assessing our practices, and that more-or-less embody wisdom that we've acquired the hard way. For example,
            we
            might have a principle that says the team is more effective when we receive daily updates from everyone on
            core
            work. We might have another principle that says disagreement is easier over high-bandwidth channels such as
            voice or video calls. This helps us make decisions quickly, and to know how fall back to a phone call if
            things
            are getting heated.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#E09133;">All of our ability with all of our capacity</h2>

        <h4>Our self-respect hinges on doing work we are proud of. Our wellbeing hinges on our work life balance. </h4>

        <p>In order to protect the quality of our work, we give it our maximum effort every time. We check in with each
            other regularly
            to honestly assess our capacity levels, and make sure we are all supported and engaged.</p>
        <p>If we need to tag each other in, we rely on our strong mutual trust and lack of judgement.</p>
        <p>We ask for help early and offer help proactively.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#E09133;">We respect production integrity and uptime</h2>

        <h4>Executing any command against production, no matter how innocuous, can take it down. </h4>

        <p>We always pair for a second set of common sense checks before a production change.</p>
