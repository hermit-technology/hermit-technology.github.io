<p>This page contains Hermit Technology's values, principles, and practices. We use strict definitions of these terms, derived from Kent Beck's book "Extreme Programming Explained".</p>
<h1>Definitions</h1>
<h2>Values</h2>
<p>Values are the things that we hold as useful at their core. For example, we might value communication, honesty, and trust.</p>
<h2>Practices</h2>
<p>Practices are specific things that we do in order to manifest our values. For example, if we value communication, we might have a weekly call to discuss issues we're facing, or a chat channel where work is posted every day. A practice that isn't rooted in a value, or that doesn't feel like it relates to a value clearly, is dead to us. Get it out of here.</p>
<h2>Principles</h2>
<p>Principles bridge the gap between values and practices, ensuring that we have broad guidelines to refer to when assessing our practices, and that more-or-less embody wisdom that we've acquired the hard way. For example, we might have a principle that says the team is more effective when we receive daily updates from everyone on core work. We might have another principle that says disagreement is easier over high-bandwidth channels such as voice or video calls. This helps us make decisions quickly, and to know how fall back to a phone call if things are getting heated.</p>
